## Neural ODE tutorials

### [notebooks/neural_ODE_code.ipynb](https://github.com/TobiBu/graddays/blob/main/day_3/notebooks/neural_ODE_code.ipynb)  
This notebook highlights the main workings and modelling perspectives of neural ODEs. It is adapted from Patrick Kidger's example notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZlK36VgWy1vBjBNXjSUg6Cb-7zeoa3jh).

### [notebooks/symbolic_regression.ipynb](https://github.com/TobiBu/graddays/blob/main/day_3/notebooks/symbolic_regression.ipynb)
This turorial on how to apply symbolic regression on learnt neural ODEs is taken from Patrick Kidger's [examples](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax/tree/main/examples) for the [diffrax package](https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/). 

If you want to play around more with neural ODEs, differentiable solvers and continuous normalizing flows please visit his [diffrax page](https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/). 

## Hamiltonian neural network tutorials

### [notebooks/HNN_tutorial_pendulum.ipynb](https://github.com/TobiBu/graddays/blob/main/day_3/notebooks/HNN_tutorial_pendulum.ipynb)  
This tutorial implements a Hamiltonian neural network for modelling a simple pendulum.

### [notebooks/HNN_tutorial_solar_system_single_planet.ipynb](https://github.com/TobiBu/graddays/blob/main/day_3/notebooks/HNN_tutorial_solar_system_single_planet.ipynb)   
In this tutorial you will train a HNN on real data of the solar system. This notebook focusses on a single planet orbit.

### [notebooks/HNN_tutorial_solar.ipynb](https://github.com/TobiBu/graddays/blob/main/day_3/notebooks/HNN_tutorial_solar.ipynb)   
In this tutorial you will train a HNN on real data of the solar system. This notebook focusses on modelling several planet orbits simultaneously.
