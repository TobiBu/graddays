## Deep Operator Learning tutorials

### [notebooks/operator_learning.ipynb](https://github.com/TobiBu/graddays/blob/main/day_3/notebooks/operator_learning.ipynb) 
This notebook provides an exemplary implementation of operator learning. In the application below, we will train a DeepONet to predict the trajectories of a chemical reaction network, i.e., how chemical abundances evolve over time given the initial abundances at some time t=0. The data was generated by numerically solving the coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the reaction network. For more information on the data, refer to e.g. [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06015). This tutorial was kindly provided by Robin Janssen. 

### [notebooks/operator_learning.ipynb](https://github.com/TobiBu/graddays/blob/main/day_3/notebooks/DeepONet_train_HeatDiff.ipynb) 
This tutorial presents a slightly more advance application of deep operator learning applied to heat diffusion in 2d.
