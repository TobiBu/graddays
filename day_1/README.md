In the folder slides you find the pdf of the lecture slides and the folder notebooks contains jupyter notebooks for the tutorials.

## Autodiff tutorial

### [notebooks/demo_python_AD.ipynb](https://github.com/TobiBu/graddays/blob/main/day_1/notebooks/demo_python_AD.ipynb)
This tutorial notebook contains some simple code to demonstarte autodiff in python. We cover all, pytorch, tensorflow and jax.

### [notebooks/demo_julia_AD.ipynb](https://github.com/TobiBu/graddays/blob/main/day_1/notebooks/demo_julia_AD.ipynb)
This tutorial notebook contains some simple code to demonstarte autodiff in julia.

### More general tutorials
A very cool and exhaustive tutorial for autodiff can be found [here:](https://theoryandpractice.org/stats-ds-book/autodiff-tutorial.html)

And the JAX documentation on autodiff is also a really great resource to read up on the details of autodiff and higher order derivatives.
See [here](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/automatic-differentiation.html) for more details.
